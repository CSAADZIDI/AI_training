# AI_training

Hello AI world! 

This project presents the curriculum of **my artificial intelligence training program**. This repository contains all the concepts covered, all the languages ​​learned, all the activities completed during this training, and, most importantly, the resources needed to get you started on your incredible journey into the world of AI. 

It's time to begin the adventure, ready? go!



A gentle introduction with the main programming language used in AI: **Python**:

>github repo: https://github.com/CSAADZIDI/init_Python


A project aimed at practicing **object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python**, **teamwork**, and in particular **Git** for version control:

>github repo: https://github.com/CSAADZIDI/wa-tor



The essential and necessary libraries for AI are the following: **Numpy** for matrix operations, **Matplotlib** for visualization, and **Pandas** for data manipulation:

Okay, we are now ready to discuss machine learning (ML), a subfield of data science.
Machine learning can be either supervised or unsupervised.
Supervised machine learning can be of two types:

**Classification** (target: discrete value/class)
exp: Logistic Regression (yes its name is regression but it's not a regression)

>github repo: https://github.com/CSAADZIDI/ML_demo_logistic_regression

>github repo: https://github.com/CSAADZIDI/ML_challenge_logistic_regression



or **Regression** (target: continuous value)
exp: Linear Regression

>github repo: https://github.com/CSAADZIDI/ML_challenge_linear_regression


Excellent work so far! It's now time to explore something more sophisticated: multilayer neural networks :joy: in other words, **deep learning**.

DL can be used for many use cases including classification and regression.
Here is an example of classification usage:

>github repo (guess if a number is from the set {0, 1, 2, ..., 9}): https://github.com/CSAADZIDI/DL_demo_classification_mnist

>github repo (guess if it's a dog or a cat): https://github.com/CSAADZIDI/DL_challenge_classification_pets

Let's now move on to **transfer learning with convolutional neural networks (CNNs)**, an important category of DL:

>github repo (pneumonia detection + *API* + gui using **Streamlit** + **Mlflow** for ML tracking): https://github.com/CSAADZIDI/DL_TransferLearning_CNN


Let's now delve into the field of generative artificial intelligence and see how we can leverage **large language models (LLMs)**.

To do this, let's explore **LangChain**, an open-source framework that allows you to create AI applications and conversational AIs based on large language models (LLMs).


>github repo: https://github.com/CSAADZIDI/LangChain_Intro

Here's how to create an intelligent **React agent equipped with tools** using LangChain:

>github repo: https://github.com/CSAADZIDI/LangChain_Agent_Tools

Here is an example of improved language models based on documents **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**:

>github repo: https://github.com/CSAADZIDI/LangChain_RAG


A group project aimed at creating a **chatbot** to help users obtain information about job offers and professional integration:

>github repo: https://github.com/CSAADZIDI/Agent-IA



It's now time to move on to the model inference phase. We used **REST APIs**, and more specifically **FastAPI**, to expose the AI ​​models.

>github repo (ML project life cycle + FastAPI to expose ensemble learning model such as XGBoost, used to predict house price + tests unitaires): https://github.com/CSAADZIDI/Fast-api-ml-immo-project



You are an ingenious developer ? you should be familiar with **Django** for both backend and frontend development:

Okay, you're excellent at AI models, you're an expert in exploratory data analysis (EDA) with Python, you're a champion at application development, and you're perfectly proficient in developing and using APIs. Now let's move on to data, data, and more data – it's the heart of AI. So, let's manipulate the data, collect it, extract it, clean it, load it, transform it, and perform other data operations in databases:


For mobile application development, start with **Dart** and **Flutter**:

>github repo: https://github.com/CSAADZIDI/init_dart
>github repo: https://github.com/CSAADZIDI/init_flutter



**Advanced SQL** for interacting with structured relational databases (joins, and more)

Practice with **PostgreSQL**, an example of an object-oriented database (OODB) that handles more diverse data types than traditional numerical and textual data.

Another type of database is the document-oriented database. Explore it with:

**MongoDB**, a simple and efficient database management system for modern databases.

>github repo: https://github.com/CSAADZIDI/Mongodb_project


**Web scraping**, another method for collecting & loading data.
>github repo: https://github.com/CSAADZIDI/init_Web_Scraping

>github repo (**Scrapy** + Clean Architecture + Azure SQL DB + MangoDB): https://github.com/CSAADZIDI/webscrapy_project

For handling big data, explore *Hadoop*, **PySpark**, and **Azure Databricks**:

>github repo: https://github.com/CSAADZIDI/init_Hadoop

>github repo: https://github.com/CSAADZIDI/init_Pyspark

>github repo: https://github.com/CSAADZIDI/Databricks_project


Discover **Airflow**, an advanced data pipeline management tool that goes beyond traditional **ETL** and **ELT** pipelines:

>github repo (ML pipeline + email notification): https://github.com/CSAADZIDI/Airflow_project


Thanks to its numerous advantages, cloud computing is now essential for all businesses. It offers a wide range of services, including artificial intelligence services.
